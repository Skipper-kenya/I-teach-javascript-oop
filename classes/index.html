      //OOP with javascript classes

      //definition
      //syntax for defining a javascript class

      //class classname{}

      class MyFriends {}

      //javascript classes have instance properties(props) and instance methods(function)

      //we can define an instance props for the myFriends class  using constructor keyword as follows

      class myFriends {
        constructor(name, age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
        }
      }

      //we can define instance methods for the myFriends class as follows

      //NB WE ARE USING DIFFERENT CLASS NAME TO GO ABOUT WITH JAVASCRIPT ALGORITHM BUT YOU CAN AS WELL COMMENT THE ABOVE CLASS AND USE THE SAME CLASS NAME

      class myFriends1 {
        constructor(name, age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
        }

        //we are having instance method below;

        displayFriends() {
          return `my name is ${this.name} and i'm ${this.age} years old.`;
        }
      }

      //we can call the displayFriends method by creating an object instance as shown below

      const elvis = new myFriends1("Elvis", 22);

      //calling the displayFriends method
      console.log(elvis.displayFriends()); // we print out to the console what our instance method return

      // we can as well create a second friend named peter

      const peter = new myFriends1("Peter", 20);
      console.log(peter.displayFriends());

      /*WE ARE DONE WITH THE BASICS NOW LETS LOOK AT GETTER AND SETTER METHODS*/

      //setter methods => initialize with set keyword followed by method name

      //getter methods => initialize with get keyword followed by method name

      //EXAMPLE

      class FrontEnd {
        constructor() {
          this._language;
        }

        //getter
        get language() {
          return `you requested for ${this._language}`;
        }
        set language(language) {
          this._language = language;
        }

        // setter;
        set language(lang) {
          this._language = lang;
        }
      }

      //we can now add a language by creating an object instance and calling in the setter function to add a language later on we will add the getter function to see what we have set

      const html = new FrontEnd();
      //setter function
      html.language = "html";
      //getter function
      console.log(html.language);
